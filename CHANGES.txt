1.0.0 (2007-01-21)
------------------

- Removed the two vocabulary AvailableTranslationDomainLanguagesVocabulary
  and AvailableTranslationDomainLanguagesVocabularyForZ3C which depend on the 
  zope.app.i18n implementation. Note this vocabulary are not persistent and
  if you will need it, let's implement this in another package. This allow us
  to skip all dependencies to zope.app.i18n

- Moved zope.language.negotiator to it's namespace package
