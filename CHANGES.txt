1.1.3 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.1.2 (2010-08-05)
------------------

- Fixed an issue with the cache:
  The cache just ignored the ``languages`` parameter.
  The first request saved a specific language (e.g. ``de-de``) to the cache,
  but the second did not have that available in ``languages``, still the cached
  value was returned.
  Worst case the uncached method is called.


1.1.1 (2010-07-21)
------------------

- added language choice caching, is by default turned off

- test coverage is now 100%


1.1.0 (2009-11-29)
------------------

- adjust dependencies, reflect changes in zope packages

- clanup tests, remove unused tests and skip using zope.app.testing


1.0.1 (2008-01-24)
------------------

- Bug: Corrected meta data.


1.0.0 (2008-01-21)
------------------

- Restructure: Removed the two vocabularies
  ``AvailableTranslationDomainLanguagesVocabulary`` and
  ``AvailableTranslationDomainLanguagesVocabularyForZ3C`` which depend on the
  ``zope.app.i18n`` implementation. Note these vocabularies are not persistent
  and if you will need it, let's implement this in another package. This
  allows us to skip all dependencies to ``zope.app.i18n``.

- Restructure: Moved ``zope.language.negotiator`` to it's namespace package.
